![preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trwnh/quasselclient-qss/master/quasselclient_2018-06-30_02-52-48.png)

# installation
- copy it to quassel/styles/custom.qss
- select custom style
- set custom font(s) for chat view, because they're not hardcoded right now

# etc
- more info about quassel: https://quassel-irc.org
- the font size is set to 24px by default because my laptop is 220dpi and i use it at 100% scaling. change this to suit your monitor resolution, if you download this for your own use on a lower-density monitor or if you use dpi scaling.
- no support given but suggestions/whatever can be sent to [@trwnh@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@trwnh)
- if for some reason you appreciate this very basic theme for an incredibly niche application, then you may tip me at [paypal.me/trwnh](http://paypal.me/trwnh) or [liberapay.com/trwnh](http://liberapay.com/trwnh)
